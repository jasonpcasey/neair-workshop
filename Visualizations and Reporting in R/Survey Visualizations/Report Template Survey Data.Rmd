## Introduction

You can write text anywhere in the white space. Just as you would using Word. You can also **bold** words or *italic* words as much as you want. If you know html you can use that knowledge in these files as well. For a Markdown Quick Reference help file click Help -> Markdown Quick Reference up above.  

### Summary

You can also add tables like the one below. As well as inline R code used below to find the number of observations in each dataset. 

Dataset       | Number of rows
------------- | -------------
```survey```  | `r prettyNum(nrow(survey), ",")`
```meta```    | `r prettyNum(nrow(meta), ",") `

### Survey Data
Topline frequencies.
```{r likert item, echo=F, results='hide', fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
abilities <- survey %>%  
  select(kccrit, kclead, kcsynth, kcrelate, kcwrite, kcjudge) %>%  
  mutate(kccrit = factor(kccrit, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")),
         kclead = factor(kclead, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")),
         kcsynth = factor(kcsynth, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")),
         kcrelate = factor(kcrelate, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")),
         kcwrite = factor(kcwrite, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")),
         kcjudge = factor(kcjudge, levels = c("Very little or none","Some","Quite a bit", "Very much")))

colnames(abilities) <-  as.character(meta$item)[match(names(abilities), meta$variable)]

abilities_likert <- likert(abilities)

p4 <- likert.bar.plot(abilities_likert) + 
  ggtitle("College's Contribution to Abilities and Knowledge") + 
  theme_bw()
p4
```

Survey questions disagregated by survey administration. 
```{r likert groups, echo=F, results='hide', warning=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=11}
proptab <- function (item, group) {
  tab <- table(item, group) 
  proptab <- tab %>%
    prop.table(2)
  test <- chisq.test(tab)
  return(list(tab = proptab, pvalue = test$p.value))
}

likert_plot <- function(ds, variables, ordered_levels, meta_item, meta_variable, cutby, group_labels, title, ...) { # inputs
  s <- subset(ds, select=variables) # select the variables that will be included in the graph
  for (i in 1:length(names(s))) { # for each variable do the following:
    print(paste(names(s)[i],"-", meta_item[meta_variable==names(s)[i]])) # print the variable name and the corresponding item
    s[,i] <- factor(s[,i], levels = ordered_levels) # order the variable based on the levels provided
    tb <- proptab(item = s[,i], group=cutby) # create a cross tab of the variable with the cutby variable specified and run a chi-square test
    colnames(s)[i] <-  ifelse(is.na(tb$pvalue), # if the pvalue from the chi-square test is missing (meaning there wasn't enough for the test)
                              as.character(meta_item)[match(names(s)[i], meta_variable)], # then change the variable name to the corresponding readable name
                              ifelse(tb$pvalue <= 0.05, # else if the p-value is less then the standard 0.05 cutoff
                                     paste0(meta_item[match(names(s[i]), meta_variable)], "*"), # then change the variable name to a concatination of the readable name with a significance star
                                     as.character(meta_item)[match(names(s)[i], meta_variable)])) # else change the variable name to the corresponding readable name
    print(tb) # print out the table
    rm(tb) # remove the table (keeps environment clean)
  }
  resg <- likert(s, grouping = cutby) # run the data through the likert function and group the data by the cutby variable
  plot <- likert.bar.plot(resg, group.order=group_labels, decimal = 1, ...) + # plot the results keeping the cutby variable levels in order
    ggtitle(title) + # add title
    theme_bw() # add personalized theme
  
  return(plot) # output the plot
}

Notice the \* next to Relating well to people of different races, nations, and religions. The \* denotes significance in a chi-square test. Remember at R's core it is meant for both statistics and data visualizations.

It is not a question of whether it can be done but of how to code it.
