## Introduction

You can write text anywhere in the white space. Just as you would when using Word. You can also **bold** words or *italic* words as much as you want. If you know html you can use that knowledge in these files as well. For a Markdown Quick Reference help file click Help -> Markdown Quick Reference up above.  

### Summary

You can also add tables like the one below. As well as inline R code used below to find the number of observations in each dataset. 

Dataset       | Number of rows
------------- | -------------
  ```ipeds_adm```  | `r prettyNum(nrow(ds), ",")`

### Scatter Plot

#### Research Question 1
What is the relationship between admit rate and yield for public institutions in MA, NY, and NJ?
  
```{r line count, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
ds1 <- ds %>% # take the full dataset THEN
  mutate(`Admit rate` = `Admissions total`/`Applicants total`, # create a new variable called Admit rate calculated as admitted total over applicants total
         `Yield` = `Enrolled total`/`Admissions total`) # create another new variable called Yield calculated as enrolled total over admitted total

p1 <- ggplot(ds1, aes(x = `Admit rate`, y = `Yield`, color = `State abbreviation`)) + # create the coordinate plane mapping Admit rate to the x axis and Yield to the y axis, and State to color then ADD
  geom_point(size = 2) + # points and increase the size of the points
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Admit Rate", 
                     limits = c(0, 1), 
                     labels = scales::percent) + # change the x axis title and limits to start the graph at zero
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Yield", 
                     limits = c(0, 1), 
                     labels = scales::percent) + # change the y axis title and limits to start the graph at zero
  ggtitle("Admit Rate vs Yield") + # then add a title
  theme_bw() # change the default theme
p1
```

### Line Chart

#### Research Question 2
Has the average admit rate changed over time for public institutions in MA, NY, or NJ?
```{r line percent, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
ds2 <- ds1 %>% 
  group_by(`State abbreviation`,`ACAD_YEAR`) %>% 
  summarise(N = n(), avg_admit = mean(`Admit rate`))

p2 <- ggplot(ds2, aes(x = ACAD_YEAR, y = avg_admit, group = `State abbreviation`, color = `State abbreviation`, shape = `State abbreviation`)) + 
  geom_line(lwd = 1.5) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = 'Academic Year', 
                     breaks = seq(2009,2016, by=1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Average Admit Rate',
                     limits = c(0,1),
                     labels = scales::percent) + 
  scale_colour_manual(name = '', 
                      labels = c('MA', 'NY', "NJ"), 
                      values = c('darkred', 'darkgreen', 'darkblue')) +
  scale_shape_manual(name = '', 
                     labels = c('MA', 'NY', "NJ"), 
                     values = c(15, 16, 17)) +
  ggtitle('Average Admit Rate Over Time') + 
  theme_bw()
p2
```

### Bar Chart

#### Research Question 3
Are public institutions in MA, NY and NJ becoming test optional?

```{r bar, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
ds3 <- ds1 %>% select(UNITID, `Institution (entity) name`, `State abbreviation`, `Admission test scores`, ACAD_YEAR)

p3 <- ggplot(ds3, aes(x = ACAD_YEAR, fill = `Admission test scores`)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percent of Institutions",
                     limits = c(0,1),
                     labels = scales::percent) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Academic Year", 
                     breaks = seq(2009, 2016, by=2)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Admission Test Scores",
                    values = c("gold", "blue", "purple")) +
  facet_grid(.~`State abbreviation`) + # rows~columns
  ggtitle("Admission Test Score Requirments Over Time") + 
  theme_bw()

p3
```

It is not a question of whether it can be done but of how to code it.
